	<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Rape</h3>
	<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Rape in India has been described by Radha Kumar as one of India's most common crimes against women.[18] Official sources show that rape cases in India have doubled between 1990 and 2008.[19] While already on an upward curve, rape cases suddenly spiked in 2013.[20]

Disturbing incidents of rape on senior citizens[21] and infants[22] are increasingly common. The incidence of rape had gone up significantly during the COVID-19 pandemic in India.[23]

As of 2018, it was the fourth most common crime against women with the number of registered rape cases rising from 32,559 in 2017 to 33,356. Of these, 31,320 cases (93.9%) had a culprit who was known to the victim. The states which saw the highest absolute number of rapes were Madhya Pradesh (5,433 or 16.3% of all cases),[24] Rajasthan (4,355 or 13%), Uttar Pradesh (3,946 or 11.8%), Maharashtra (2,142 or 6.4%) and Chhattisgarh (2,091 or 6%).

In 2018, the national average rape rate (per 1,00,000 population) was 5.2, same as the previous year. Tamil Nadu (0.9), Nagaland (1.0) and Bihar (1.1) had the lowest rape rates while Chhattisgarh (14.7) had the highest rape rate.</h5></br>

<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Dowry</h3>
<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Dowries are considered a major contributor towards the violence against women in India. Some of these offences include physical violence, emotional abuses, and murder of brides and girls.[25][26][27]

Most dowry deaths occur when the young woman, unable to bear the harassment and torture, commits suicide. Most of these suicides are by hanging, poisoning or by fire. Sometimes the woman is killed by setting her on fire – this is known as bride burning, and is sometimes disguised as suicide or accident.[28] In 2012, 8,233 dowry death cases were reported across India.[29] Dowry issues caused 1.4 deaths per year per 100,000 women in India.[30][31]</h5><br>

<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Petty Crime</h3>
<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Petty crime, like pickpocketing, theft of valuables from luggage on trains and buses have been reported. Travelers who are not in groups become easy victims of pickpockets and purse snatchers. Purse snatchers work in crowded areas.[69]</h5><br>

<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Taxi Scam</h3>
<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">There are also taxi scams present in India, whereby a foreign traveller, who is not aware of the locations around Indian airports, is taken for a ride round the whole airport and charged for full-fare taxi ride while the terminal is only few hundred yards away.[69] Overseas Security Advisory Council in a report mentioned the process about how to avoid taxi-scam. This crime is known in other areas of the world as "long-hauling".[69]</h5><br>

<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Arms Trafficking</h3>
<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">According to a joint report published by Oxfam, Amnesty International and the International Action Network on Small Arms (IANSA) in 2006, there are around 40 million illegal small arms in India out of approximately 75 million in worldwide circulation.[48] Majority of the illegal small arms make its way into the states of Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Orissa and Madhya Pradesh.[48] In UP, a used AK-47 costs $3,800 in black market.[49] Large amount of illegal small arms are manufactured in various illegal arms factories in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and sold on the black market for as little as $5.08.[48]

Chinese pistols are in demand in the illegal small arms market in India because they are easily available and cheaper.[48] This trend poses a significant problem for the states of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Orissa, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh which have influence of Naxalism.[48] The porous Indo-Nepal border is an entry point for Chinese pistols, AK-47 and M-16 rifles into India as these arms are used by the Naxalites who have ties to Maoists in Nepal.[48]

In North-East India, there is a huge influx of small arms due to the insurgent groups operating there.[50] The small arms in North-East India come from insurgent groups in Burma, black markets in Southeast Asia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka, black market in Cambodia, the People's Republic of China, insurgent groups like the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, the Communist Party of India (Maoist), the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist), Indian states like Uttar Pradesh and pilferages from legal gun factories, criminal organisations operating in India and South Asian countries and other international markets like Romania, Germany etc.[50] Illegal weaponry found in North-East India includes small arms such as the M14, M16, AK-47, AK-56, and the AK-74, but also light machine guns, Chinese hand grenades, mines, rocket-propelled grenade launchers and submachine guns etc.[50]

The Ministry of External Affairs and Ministry of Home Affairs drafted a joint proposal to the United Nations, seeking a global ban on small-arms sales to non-state users.[48]</h5><br>

<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Domestic Violence</h3>
<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Domestic violence in India is endemic.[32] Around 70% of women in India are victims of domestic violence, according to Renuka Chowdhury, former Union minister for Women and Child Development.[33]

The National Crime Records Bureau reveals that a crime against a woman is committed every three minutes, a woman is raped every 29 minutes, a dowry death occurs every 77 minutes, and one case of cruelty committed by either the husband or relative of the husband occurs every nine minutes.[34] This occurs despite the fact that women in India are legally protected from domestic abuse under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.[34]</h5><br>

<h3 class="text-primary" style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">Illegal Drug Trade</h3>
<h5 style=" font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">India is located between two major illicit opium producing centres in Asia – the Golden Crescent comprising Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iran and the Golden Triangle comprising Burma, Thailand and Laos.[35] Because of such geographical location, India experiences large amount of drug trafficking through the borders.[36] India is the world's largest producer of licit opium for the pharmaceutical trade.[37] But an undetermined quantity of opium is diverted to illicit international drug markets.[37]

India is a transshipment point for heroin from Southwest Asian countries like Afghanistan and Pakistan and from Southeast Asian countries like Burma, Laos, and Thailand.[38] Heroin is smuggled from Pakistan and Burma, with some quantities transshipped through Nepal.[38] Most heroin shipped from India are destined for Europe.[38] There have been reports of heroin smuggled from Mumbai to Nigeria for further export.[38]

In Maharashtra, Mumbai is an important centre for distribution of drug.[39] The most commonly used drug in Mumbai is Indian heroin (called desi mal by the local population).[39] Both public transportation (road and rail transportation) and private transportation are used for this drug trade.[39]

Drug trafficking affects the country in many ways.

Drug abuse: Cultivation of illicit narcotic substances and drug trafficking affects the health of the individuals and destroy the economic structure of the family and society.[40][41]
Organised crime: Drug trafficking results in growth of organised crime which affects social security. Organised crime connects drug trafficking with corruption and money laundering.[41]
Political instability: Drug trafficking also aggravates the political instability in North-West and North-East India.[42]
A survey conducted in 2003–2004 by Narcotics Control Bureau found that India has at least four million drug addicts.[43] The most common drugs used in India are cannabis, hashish, opium and heroin.[43] In 2006 alone, India's law enforcing agencies recovered 230 kg heroin and 203 kg of cocaine.[44] In an annual government report in 2007, the United States named India among 20 major hubs for trafficking of illegal drugs along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Burma. However, studies reveal that most of the criminals caught in this crime are either Nigerian or US nationals.[45]

Several measures have been taken by the Government of India to combat drug trafficking in the country. India is a party of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1961), the Convention on Psychotropic Substances (1971), the Protocol Amending the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs (1972) and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (1988).[46] An Indo-Pakistani committee was set up in 1986 to prevent trafficking in narcotic drugs.[47] India signed a convention with the United Arab Emirates in 1994 to control drug trafficking.[47] In 1995, India signed an agreement with Egypt for investigation of drug cases and exchange of information and a Memorandum of Understanding of the Prevention of Illicit Trafficking in Drugs with Iran.[47]</h5>
